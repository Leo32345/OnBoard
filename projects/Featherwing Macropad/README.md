# Featherwing Macropad
## Summary
##### I am going to make a 4-key Cherry MX macropad that will be powered by an Adafruit Featherwing. There will also be a small monochrome OLED display.

## Plan
##### 3 PCB boards from OSH Park will cost $30.85. I will buy the Adafruit Featherwing, battery, battery charger, OLED display, Cherry MX, and the keycaps using my own money. I plan to assemble/solder these myself.

## Design
##### I designed using Autodesk Eagle and I somewhat followed [this tutorial to design it](https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/12/17/layer-by-layer-cherry-mx-gamepad-in-eagle-cad/) and I will use [this other tutorial to help me assemble it](https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-wireless-bluetooth-cherry-mx-gamepad/overview).
